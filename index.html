            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">What all these skills prepare for is not just learning in school settings, but the capacity and openness to learning throughout life. Last year, when the pandemic hit, dance teachers, event organizers, and many more representatives of offline jobs had to reskill themselves and start something new. People who never had any experience in the delivery industry, changed their business model and tried to succeed in brand-new areas of life.

               <br><br> When experts say that the 4th Industrial Revolution may impact an incredible 50 percent of jobs, the COVID-experience not only seems necessary but also as an exercise for other huge changes on the horizon. Professionals who want to remain competitive in their environment will need to constantly re-skill themselves - and that’s why it is of tremendous importance to teach the next generation to cope with anything to come.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Today, teachers don’t try to be the sole spokesperson in the class, with students being passive listeners. They facilitate an environment that enables a discussion rather than a one-way lecture.

                Getting over a curriculum is no more the sole motive of the teachers. New-age teachers understand their students’ unique needs, learning style, social and cultural background, interests, and abilities and work accordingly.
                
                To thrive in a rapidly evolving, technology-mediated world, students must be adept at critical thinking, problem-solving, persistence, collaboration and curiosity. All too often, however, students are not getting trained in these skills.</p><br>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Teachers must learn how to combine multiple modes of delivery: online, offline, and blended to facilitate learning with efficacy, especially in the world we are living in right now. Today, smart education is not an option, but a strategic choice and learning are no longer limited to a closed classroom or a specific time. With the support of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), learning can be carried out irrespective of time and places. To conduct classes that’s not just within the four walls, teachers should be well-acquainted with the nuances. The role of a teacher has truly been redefined.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Reimagining learning ecosystems.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As the needs of each young learner, their family, and their community shift, the learning ecosystem can easily shift with it. This type of freedom and flexibility can’t be found within the current system—it simply wasn’t built to provide it. It’s why we call this work transformative and inventive, rather than reformative and innovative.

                To reform and innovate means you are iterating on what currently exists. To innovate on the current system and expect never-before-realized outcomes is to expect to make it to the moon by tweaking the design of a car, when in reality we need a rocketship.
                
                This proposed ecosystem for learning (and its enabling supports) is our rocketship. Yes, it will require shifting how we view the roles of adults; when, where, and how we assess and credential learning; how resources are allocated; and what governance and shared accountability structures look like.
                
                But, if we believe children are curious, wondrous, capable, and unique and families want their children to be happy, prepared, and supported to pursue their interests and ambitions, this ecosystem blueprint is one robust example of what we’d want to see within our communities. Now is the time to invent and bring to life this ecosystem of learning that can achieve those desired results.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">You may not realize initially how influential your character, your personality, can be to reach your goals. At school, you began to forge friendships, at home you experienced being constantly with others. In middle school and high school, you learned that it is easy to work with some and difficult to work with others. Group work is hard. And suddenly, you are thrown into college where you need to navigate all aspects of life while enjoying the emulation of being on a campus and living with new friends. <br>

                <br>Clearly acquiring knowledge and know-how and develop as a human being are two important dimensions of growth. The education system emphasizes much more the first one, but life has its own way of highlighting the need for the second dimension, the personal one.<br>
                
                <br>After working for a couple of years, you also realize that growth is a lifelong undertaking, and is a mean to an end. Sometimes you grow because you want to prove yourself to others, you want to show that you have the capacity to “do it”, or you want to have more impact, achieve more, reach a new ceiling, branch into a new discipline.</p>
